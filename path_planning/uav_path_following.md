## What
- Comprehensive review of path following methods for UAVS 

## METHODS
### Geometric Methods 
- LOS and pure pursuit 
- Dubins - Constrained to 
- Simple eand easy to implement but suspect to stability  

### Path Following Algorithms
- Uses two types of paths:
  - Carrot chasing algorithm,Straight line and loiter paths 
- Carrot chasing algorithm:
- 
- Straight line:
- Says Vector Fields are the best move to track systems in 3D space
