# Path Planning for Autonomous Drones: Challenges and Future Directions

Gopi Gugan * and Anwar Haque

## Current Challenges for Path Planning
- Onboard computation 
- Weather conditions 
  - Using Euler's to do numerical analysis to predict trajectory of drones under different kinds of wind conditions 

- Computing the shortest path between two points in a 3D environment with polyhedral objects is NP-hard [36].
- I like the way they did this chart on Table.1 


## What are the algorithms missing?
- Actual test
- Dynamic avoidance of areas
- Consideration of disturbances in trajectory planning
