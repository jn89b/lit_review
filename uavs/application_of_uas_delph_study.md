# Applications of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS): A Delphi Study Projecting Future UAS Missions and Relevant Challenges

Alberto Sigala 1 and Brent Langhals 2,*

## Objective of Paper 
Research objectives were designed to help UAS developers and researchers identify which mission areas may be most suitable for future autonomous UAS applications and what challenges may be encountered to reaching those missions
- 1. Determine what military missions are currently assigned to UAS and what level of autonomy is currently used for each mission. 
- 2. Identify which UAS missions are most likely in 20 years and what level of autonomy future missions are likely to possess. 
- 3. Identify challenges to implementation for future missions.

## Autonomy Terminology
- HITL - Human in the Loop
  - Agent can do action only if human operator 
- HOTL - Human out of the Loop
  - Agent can do the action by itself without need or guidance from Human confirmation


## What did they do
- Conducted a Delph Study on scope and levels of autonomy for UAS 

### First Panel
- For first panel:
  - Goal of question was to establish common starting point to assess curent UAS missions and levels of autonomy 
  - Question was: Give a list of current UAS missions and assign the max level of autonomy for the systems they have:
  - Levels were defined as :
    - 1 - None
    - 2 - HITL
    - 3 - Shared Autonomy
    - 4 - HOTL
    - 5 - Fully autonomous 
  - Results were:
    - Missions:
      - ISR 
        - Pilots had: 1-2
        - Acquisitions: 2-3
        - Academic:3-4
      - Strike/Attack
      - CSAR (Combat Search and Rescue)
      - Comms 
  - Disaparity between academics and pilots

### Second Panel
- All panelists were tasked to predict the likelihood each future mission would become operationalized over the next 20 years.
- The highest missions were:
  - ISR
  - Cargo
  - Refueling
  - Battle Coverage 
  - Command and Control
  - EW/Cyber 
- Pilots remained the most conservative toward the assignment of autonomy levels across all mission types with an average rating of 2.53 (between HITL and shared) 
- Acquisition and academic panelists, however, believed future UAS missions will achieve autonomy levels between HOTL and fully autonomous (mean = 4.27 and 4.2)


### Third Panel 
- Were then asked to evaluate the previously identified challenges to implementing mission capabilities autonomously.
- Identifying the challenges is the first step toward developing strategies to address obstacles and achieve more advanced autonomous UAS capabilities
- The challenges were naturally categorized into three groups: 
  - technological issues
  - Data requirements
  - Programmatic issues

#### Technological Challenges
- Sense and avoid 
  - Capability to sense environment and avoid obstacles
- Human machine interaction:
  - Better way to interact with UAS versus keyboards,mice and joysticks
Machine learning (ML)â€“artificial intelligence (AI) recognized the increasing role of AI/ML in the modern data analysis, especially under complexity and time constraints commonly found in aerial operations
- Data links
