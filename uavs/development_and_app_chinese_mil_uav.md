Yi-dan LUO and Han FAN

## What is this paper about 
This paper reviews the development history of Chinese military UAVs, summarizes the serial development and application of Chinese military UAVs, and proposes the future development trends: Small size and integration, large and complicated system extension, intellectualization,
invisibility and etc.

### Small UAV 
- Multi-purpose small and medium-sized UAV is characterized by long endurance and diversified
reconnaissance functions.
- Remark: Deployed by combat units, such as battalion and battery

### AI
- **Current State of UAV Intelligence:**
  - UAV intelligence is currently at a relatively low level.
  - Platform control relies on simple remote control and pre-programming.

- **Technological Developments:**
  - Rapid advancements in computer computing speed and storage capacity.
  - Progress in software, fault tolerance, pattern recognition, and adaptive reasoning.

- **Evolution of Intelligent Control:**
  - Intelligent integration of human-computer interaction is gaining prominence.
  - Future trend towards full autonomous control.

- **Anticipated Timeline:**
  - Computers approaching human intelligence expected around 2030.
  - UAV full autonomous control technology significantly improved.

- **Benefits of Advanced Autonomous Control:**
  - Reduced operator workload, minimizing human factors' interference.
  - Decreased demand for UAV communication bandwidth.

- **Enhanced Operational Capabilities:**
  - UAVs capable of tactical operations beyond the line of sight.
  - Improved adaptability to dangerous, independent, or complex battlefield environments.

- **Collaboration with Manned Aircraft:**
  - Better cooperation expected with manned aircraft and other entities in the future - Wingman?
