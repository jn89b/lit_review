## Interesting Bits
Advances in UAV interoperability will provide a variety of battlefield advantages, including improved situational awareness, transfer of surveillance data, coordination, navigation with respect to other aircraft, and even **UAV self-organization for offensive capabilities.**. [57]

Autonomy could be a major enabler in anti-access and area-denial (A2/AD) zones, where remote-piloting and real-time links may be compromised.60 Autonomy could grant UAVs the ability to continue with pre-programmed plans even if data connections are lost or communication links are compromised over A2/AD areas.61 But increasing UAV autonomy also could accelerate the tempo of conflict, which could reduce decision-making time and result in increased human error

Concerns from making system more autonomous:
- Acceleration of the Tempo of Conflict: As UAVs become more autonomous, they can operate at a faster pace. This means that decision-making processes, from identifying a target to executing a mission, can occur more rapidly. While increased tempo can be advantageous in some situations, it also poses challenges, especially if the speed of operations surpasses the ability of human operators to comprehensively assess situations.

- Reduced Decision-Making Time for Human Operators: With autonomous systems making decisions at an accelerated pace, human operators may have less time to intervene or provide oversight. This reduction in decision-making time could potentially limit the ability of human operators to thoroughly evaluate the situation, consider ethical implications, or make nuanced judgments.

- Potential for Errors or Unintended Consequences: The concern is that the faster operational tempo, coupled with reduced decision-making time for humans, may increase the likelihood of errors or unintended consequences. **In dynamic and complex environments, quick decisions without thorough human oversight could lead to suboptimal outcomes or even unintended harm.**
