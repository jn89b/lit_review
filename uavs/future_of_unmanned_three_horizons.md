# The future of unmanned combat aerial vehicles: An analysis using the Three Horizons framework

Javier Jordán

This is a very good paper to be used for the motivation of my dissertation, I can use to argue how current algorithms can't support H2/H3 systems, which will be used for the future of CUAS operations. 

- War never changes but combat evolves

## What
- Paper uses three horizons framework to help understand change underway at present for combat with the fourth industrial revolution. 

### Three Horizons
- Three horizons used to structure process of profound long-term change 
- The horizons
  - First horizon Corresponds to manned combat aviation, strategic effectiveness is being called into question 
  - Second horizon is the assistance to the first horizon 
  - Third horizon in which UCAVs take centre stage in combat missions and what potential drivers exist 
- The three horizons do not refer simply to the short, medium and long term but rather to the processes of change required to maintain strategic effectiveness in a context of change.

### Level 2 Horizon 
- RQ-170
- Skyborg - AFRL 
- Loyal Wingman the Stingray with Boeing
- Golden Horde swarm system 
- Indeed, the vision of sixth-generation systems is an H3 whose cornerstone is not a manned fighter but a ‘system of systems’ consisting of a network of manned aerial platforms, different types of unmanned platforms (accompanying; fully autonomous systems; UAVs for ISR), intelligent munitions acting in swarms, satellites, and ground systems. Manned aircraft would continue to perform direct combat missions along with support and control missions, but they would be supported by an array of unmanned systems possessing varying degrees of autonomy (Trevithick, Joseph, Rogoway, 2019).

### Level 3 Horizon 
- For H3 to happen there must be three key things:
  - Operational advantages
  - Lower acquisition and sustainment costs
  - Balance of power
- Operational advantages for full autonomy:
  - Process speed and elimination of tiredness offered by AI 
  - It will also be crucial to deal with the UCAVs of an enemyair force situated at the fore front of this H3
  - Save human lives by not needing manned pilots
  - **Clearly, a factor that militates in favour of full autonomy is the vulnerability of the link between the UCAV and its command centre to interferences from a technologically advanced enemy. Russia, for example, has successfully interfered with various types of drones in Ukraine and Syria using advanced electronic warfare systems (Trevithick, 2018). Full autonomy as protection against interference is a pragmatic criterion used already in cruise and anti-ship missiles and will be difficult to avoid in very specific tactical situations and in a context of rivalry between major powers in which Russia and China are developing and trialling their own UCAV programmes and countermeasures to neutralise unmanned enemy systems (Mayer, 2015: 771). It should be noted that enemey interfernce is less of a problem agaist  a UCAV and an advanced command post on board a manned aircraft (Rogoway, 2016b; Stillion, 2015: 43–44).**
    - This is fucking money, right now military uses human in the loop interface to make the UAS do specific tasks (Reaper,etc). 
- A final pragmatic criterion in favour of full autonomy is that the major advances achieved in AI, swarming, hypersonic weapons, **directed-energy weapons, etc,** could see battlefields become so complex and astonishingly fast that theywill surpass human capacity to manage them effectively, thus leading the bulk of decisions to be taken by AI. However, **many disruptive changes will still be required for such a scenario to come about**. In any event, this would be a hypothetical H3, to be considered if the H3 outlined here were eventually to become the H1, can we say we planning for the future? 
- Autonomy in unmanned aerial systems (UAS) is not typically full (human-out-of-the-loop) according to the H3 framework.
- Full autonomy is considered an exception, reserved for specific tactical contexts with very high risk.
- An example scenario for full autonomy is Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions against systems with advanced electronic warfare capabilities.
- SEAD missions pose high risks, justifying the use of fully autonomous systems to protect strike packages involving human-machine teaming.
- Political justifications for full autonomy are easier in high-risk scenarios, ensuring safety in critical missions like SEAD.
- SEAD operations are highlighted as prerequisites for other missions involving both manned systems and non-fully autonomous manned systems.
