I am in Year1 of my Ph.D. What I am doing now is to survey the literature every single day, trying to identify the research gap. It is a frustrating process, and my supervisor said he had students who can not find the research gap until Year2!

Anyway, I would love to give you my learnings

- Start with some big questions that you are really concerned about. Since you will spend several years on it, you would better work on a problem you have passions for. When you find the problem, you will feel it, emotionally. Then you could narrow down the problems, survey the literature, and identify the research gap.

- Finding research gaps is like identifying business opportunities for entrepreneurs. There are always competitors and alternatives in a market, but you shall find a niche area where you have a competitive advantage and there are unsolved problems for a segment.

- No research work is perfect. Most research articles would give their limitations and recommended research areas for future researchers. Checking the limitations and recommendations in the latest articles on your target area would be helpful.
