# Autonomous Air Combat Maneuvering Decision Method of UCAV Based on LSHADE-TSO-MPC under Enemy Trajectory Prediction

## Interesting notes
- Used LSTM to predict adversary trajectories 
- Can I model this with uncertainty or use Deep Q learning to create a Partial Markov Decision Making Process?
  - ie I've seen this before but uncertain of its capabiliities
  - Let's do a manuever to see how it reacts
  - Okay it does this so let's update our transition matrix and update our adversaries capabilities
