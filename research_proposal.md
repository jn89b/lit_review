# Why Research Proposal
- **Communicate** the details of your research
- **Convince** reader to approve it 3 things: 
  - Your research is crystal **clear** and well-**defined**
  - Research is well **justified** 
    - Did I fill a gap?
    - Is it unique?
    - Is it worthwhile?
  -  Is my research **realistic** and **achievable**/ Is it **doable**?
     -  Do I have the skills?
     -  Do I have the resources?

# Setting the Provisional Title
- Good research title should convey the research in what you should be doing as concise as possible 
  - What does the title communicate?

- What it communicates:
  - Broad topic
  - Focal topic
  - Context

## Introduction
- **Provide broad overview and terminology and technology**
## Terminology 
- Levels of autonomy: From Autonomous Issues
  - L1  
  - L2
  - L3
  - L4
  - L5
## Overview
  - The current technology for fighter aircraft was predominantly manned aircraft systems from the 20th century to the early 21st century
  - Development of UAS platforms tha
- Then narrow down to your **focal** topic
- Why???
  - How is the dissertation topic justified? 
  - What is the gap in the research? 
    - ie is there a lot of research in this field but not in this sector 
    - Existing research is **outdated**
  - Existing research has **methodological** issues:
    - There is a lack in x,y,z 
    - Argue that this is what you will do to address those x,y,z
