# Formal Problem Statement for PhD Research

## Research Title
**"Enhancing Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Autonomy and Combat Survivability in Military Operations: A Comprehensive Investigation into Intelligent Planning, Guidance, and Threat Prediction"**

## Problem Statement

### 1. Computation Time and Planning Challenges:
- The current computation time for UAS planning is often offline and not well-shared, leading to delays in mission execution.
- UAS must intelligently plan routes, considering factors such as obstacles, terrain, and real-time threat detections for optimal Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations.

### 2. Guidance and Control of Autonomous UAS:
- Existing nonlinear models used for guidance and control are typically linearized, offering accuracy only within specific operational parameters.
- The need for advanced control strategies to enhance the autonomy and responsiveness of UAS in diverse and dynamic military environments.

### 3. Prediction of Threats:
- Threats in military scenarios are commonly modeled as Gaussian, involving radar systems, dynamic UAS sentry systems, and potential integration with intelligent swarm systems.
- The development of sophisticated threat prediction algorithms and systems to enhance situational awareness and response capabilities.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this research are to:
- Develop novel algorithms and methodologies for efficient UAS route planning in complex operational environments.
- Investigate advanced nonlinear control strategies to improve the guidance and control mechanisms of autonomous UAS.
- Propose innovative threat prediction models and systems for military applications.

## Significance of the Research
The outcomes of this research are expected to significantly contribute to the advancement of UAS capabilities in military operations, leading to increased autonomy, survivability, and effectiveness. The proposed solutions aim to address current limitations and pave the way for the next generation of intelligent and adaptive UAS technologies in military contexts.
